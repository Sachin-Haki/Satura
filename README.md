# Satura
Carta is a tool which utilizes AutoML(automated machine learning) technology to predict and provide predictive analysis
about the market saturation of  a certain product in a market.
Market saturation arises when the volume of a product or service in a marketplace has been maximized,this situation is 
often created by big brands and major players in that industry
leaving little to no scope for that product in that industry ,forcing the small time enterpreneurs to check for new 
products to sale or change the market alltogether
the enterpreneurs often find the market saturation hitting them later in the game ,leaving them with a huge loss
Carta solves this problems by creating a key word universe related to that industry and data mining the analytics for 
the past 4 years
and training that AutoML model with that data and that model arrives with a solution of whether there is a scope for that
 product in that industry
The reason for using AutoML instead of traditional Machine learning is that the target audience (small time enterpreneurs) 
are new and learning in their field , they normally focus on learning their
trade ,so we can't force them to learn a tool which comprises of a technology with a very high learning curve such as 
Machine learning
Automated Machine Learning provides methods and processes to make Machine Learning available for non-Machine Learning 
experts, to improve efficiency of Machine Learning.
